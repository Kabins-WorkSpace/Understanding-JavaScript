# Variables

## Definition
-> Variables are the containers that are used to store the value. 

## 3 Valid ways to name a variable

  1) let variable7 = 12;
  2) var variable7 = 12;
  3) const variable7 = 12; // Can't be re-assigned with a new value later on in a program i.e. becomes constant.

## Naming Convention
-> There are several ways to name a variable.
   1) camelCase Convention -> variableName -> mostly used in JS
   2) PascalCase Convention -> VariableName -> Used for just one single purpose in JS
   3) snake_case Convention -> variable_name -> popular in other languages
   4) kebab-case Convention -> variable-name -> used for naming files mostly

## Syntax Rules in JS for Variables

-> Points to be taken into consideration while naming variables
   1) Can't start with a number, but number can be used in any position other than the beginning -> 7variable ❌ -> variable7, var7iable ✅
   2) Can use only $ and _ as special characters -> variableName$, variable_Name ✅
   3) Can't use special words like let -> let let = 7; ❌ -> let let7 = 7; ✅

## Shortcuts for assigning and re-assigning a value to a variable

-> Valid ways
  1) += -> variable += 2; -> variable = variable + 2;
  2) -= -> variable -= 2; -> variable = variable - 2;
  3) *= -> variable *= 2; -> variable = variable * 2;
  4) /= -> variable /= 2; -> variable = variable / 2;

# Note 

-> While inserting a value into a string, we use a template string.
   e.g. console.log(`Cart Quantity : ${cartQuantity}`)
