# DOM (Document Object Model)

-> DOM in JS is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of Objects allowing JS to interact with HTML and XML documents dynamically. 
What it basically means is that it combines HTML and JS together in such a way that JS gets the full control of the webpage.
-> When HTML element is inside a JS, it behaves like JS objects.
