# HTML, CSS & JS Together

Basically, thats what we know is needed and we finally touched the extreme basics of how a website should work. HTML is used for the structure of the website, CSS is used to make it look good and JS makes it functional and reactive.

But, in order to not make the file too big and cluttered, we separate it into multiple files. We link CSS into our HTML code by adding a CSS file in <link rel="stylesheet" href="CSS-file"> and JS code into <script src="JS-file></script>

One more thing we learned in this tutorial is that, we can add a class to modify its CSS by using JS. 

-> elementName.classList.add(className);
-> elementName.classList.remove(className);
