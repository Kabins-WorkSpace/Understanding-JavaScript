# Advanced Functions

-> Functions are used to keep our code clean by making repetitive task being done through functions. We have discussed already about the simpler functions, in this directory we learned more about advanced functions.

## setTimeout(function, time)

-> This function is used to execute the passed function after the mentioned time. It makes the code asynchronous i.e. won't wait for a line to finish its execution before running the next line.

## setInterval(function, time)

-> This function is used to repeat the passed function in the regular interval.

## forEach 

-> Its an another method to loop through the loop. Since, its much easier to read compared to for loop, its preferred over for loop if we don't need to use break statement in the loop because for each doesnt support break statements.

-> array.forEach(function(value, index){ });
